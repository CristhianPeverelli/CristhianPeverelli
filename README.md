# Hi!

My name is Cristhian Peverelli, and actually I am a student at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano. I spend most of my time on mobile games development in _Unity_ and at solving coding puzzles/challenges on _Codewars.com_ or the _The Advent of Code_ (most of them are written using Java or Golang).

## Some of my projects

* _Pevefast_: A 3D running game that is in an advanced state of development. I will publish it on Google Play Store in the upcoming months
* _[Tic Tac Toe in Logisim](https://github.com/CristhianPeverelli/Logisim-Tris-Project)_: As the name says, its a simulation of the Tris (or Tic Tac Toe) built in Logisim with only logic circuits
* _[My Codewars.com Challenges](https://github.com/CristhianPeverelli/Codewars-Challenge)_: Some challenges solutions mainly aimed at problem solving
